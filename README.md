# Deep-Learning

The term “Deep” of Deep Learning refers to the numbers of hidden layers in the neural network. A neural network with huge numbers of hidden layers is called a Deep Neural Network. It is a superpower with it you can make a computer see, synthesize novel Art, Translate Languages, Render a Medical Diagnosis, or Build Pieces of Car that can drive Itself.
Deep learning (DL) is the type of machine learning (ML) that resembles human brains where it learns from data by using artificial neural networks. Just like human brains, these deep neural networks learn from real life examples. In a few cases it has surpassed human intelligence, just like Google's AlphaGo has defeated number one Go Player Ke Jie. DL uses multiple neural network layers to process larger amounts of data and predict results with high accuracy. It has become the industry standard as it is now used in self-driving cars, fraud detection and forecasting weather.

# Supervised Learning
Supervised learning uses a labeled dataset to train models to either classify data or predict values. The dataset contains features and target labels, which allow the algorithm to learn over time by minimizing the loss between predicted and actual labels. Supervised learning can be divided into classification and regression problems.

# Classification
 The classification algorithm divides the dataset into various categories based on feature extractions. The popular deep learning models are ResNet50 for image classification and BERT (language model)) for text classification.
 
# Regression
 Instead of dividing the dataset into categories, the regression model learns the relationship between input and output variables to predict the outcome. Regression models are commonly used for predictive analysis, weather forecasting, and predicting stock market performance. LSTM and RNN are popular deep learning regression models.
 
# Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning algorithms learn the pattern within an unlabeled dataset and create clusters. Deep learning models can learn hidden patterns without human interventions and these models are often used in recommendation engines. Unsupervised learning is used for grouping various species, medical imaging and market research. The most common deep learning model for clustering is the deep embedded clustering algorithm.
