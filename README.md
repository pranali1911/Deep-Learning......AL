# Deep-Learning

Deep learning (DL) is the type of machine learning (ML) that resembles human brains where it learns from data by using artificial neural networks. Just like human brains, these deep neural networks learn from real life examples. In a few cases it has surpassed human intelligence, just like Google's AlphaGo has defeated number one Go Player Ke Jie. DL uses multiple neural network layers to process larger amounts of data and predict results with high accuracy. It has become the industry standard as it is now used in self-driving cars, fraud detection and forecasting weather.

# Deep Learning Models workflow

  Deep learning models are trained by using large sets of labeled data and neural network architectures that learn 
  features directly from the data without the need for manual feature extraction.

One of the most popular types of deep neural networks is known as convolutional neural networks (CNN or ConvNet). A CNN convolves learned features with input data, and uses 2D convolutional layers, making this architecture well suited to processing 2D data, such as images.

CNNs eliminate the need for manual feature extraction, so you do not need to identify features used to classify images. The CNN works by extracting features directly from images. The relevant features are not pretrained; they are learned while the network trains on a collection of images. This automated feature extraction makes deep learning models highly accurate for computer vision tasks such as object classification.

CNNs learn to detect different features of an image using tens or hundreds of hidden layers. Every hidden layer increases the complexity of the learned image features. For example, the first hidden layer could learn how to detect edges, and the last learns how to detect more complex shapes specifically catered to the shape of the object we are trying to recognize.
